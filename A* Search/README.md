A program to find the shortest solution to the doublets word problem. Implements d-ary min heap to implement A* search to find shortest path between the start and end word

Doublets: 
You start with two words, both with the same number of letters. You link these two words by interposing other words, each of which differing from the previous word by one letter only. You begin by changing one letter in the first word to create a new word. You repeat this process, changing one letter at a time and creating new words, until you end up with the second word.

Ex: APE -> ARE -> ERE -> ERR -> EAR -> MAR -> MAN
