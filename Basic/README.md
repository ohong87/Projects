Created BASIC interpreter to understand the following commands: 

LET: Assigns a value to a variable.
END or .: Marks the end of the program.
PRINT: Prints the value of a variable.
PRINTALL: Prints all variables and their values.
ADD: Adds a value to a variable.
SUB: Subtracts a value from a variable.
MULT: Multiplies a variable by a value.
DIV: Divides a variable by a value.
GOTO: Jumps to a specific line number in the program.
IF: Performs a conditional jump based on a comparison.
GOSUB: Jumps to a specific line number and remembers the current line number to return to.
RETURN: Returns from a GOSUB statement.

These functions allow for basic arithmetic operations, variable assignment, conditional branching, and subroutine calls.
